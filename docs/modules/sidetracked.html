                    <p class="lead">For many years, I have included the phrase "Not sidetracked by sizzle" in my personal profile. "Sidetracked by sizzle" refers to the tendency to be attracted to flashy technologies that may not ultimately contribute to the success of a project or solution.</p>
                    <p>Getting "sidetracked by sizzle" happens when people are more focused on the "sizzle" or the perceived value, rather than the actual impact on the business. As a result, they may spend time on these features, only to find that they do not contribute to the overall success of the project. By avoiding this tendency and focusing the benefit to the business, it is possible to deliver more effective and successful solutions.</p>
                    <h2 class="mb-0">How can I tell if I have been sidetracked?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When I am more focused on the perceived value of a feature, rather than its actual impact on the business.</li>
                        <li>When I find that I have invested a significant amount of time and resources into a feature, even if it is not clear how it will benefit the business.</li>
                        <li>When I am more focused on impressing stakeholders with flashy features, rather than addressing their real needs.</li>

                        <li>When I do not consider the potential risks or downsides of a feature, and not taking a risk management approach to decision-making.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When I find any of things happening, I step back and reevaluate the priorities and focus on solutions that will truly benefit the business and contribute to its success.</p>

                    <p>For a project manager, their primary objective should be to deliver business success to their clients. However, it is very common for project managers to get sidetracked in the process and lose focus on that goal.

                        <dd>Make sure you understand the measurable business value of any features that you develop. For example, what return on investment may the feature deliver? Will it increase revenue or help reduce costs?</dd>
                        <dt>Step Three:</dt>
                        <dd>Prioritize features based on business value and ensure they are reviewed regularly. By taking the time to review the progress of each feature, you will be able to keep your focus on the biggest value drivers and avoid getting sidetracked by unnecessary sizzle.</dd>
