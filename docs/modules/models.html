                    <h3>Data & Analytical Models</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rapidly cross-referencing and analyzing an organization's processes against regulatory requirements and best practice frameworks is a critical component of any transformation assessment.  Mapping those varied elements to an organization's roles, skills and responsibilities can only be efficiently accomplished with a robust data and analytics model.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Evaluating enterprise IT processes should begin with creation of a clear 'baseline' of the current process and control environment. To establish the baseline, the relationship between procedures, standards, roles, skills, best practices, regulatory requirements must be explicitly defined. Once defined, the baseline is used to complete a 'gap analysis' of an organization’s process and control hierarchy through a capability maturity assessment process.

                        <strong>Bottom line:</strong>
                        The Control Origins team leveraged deep experience in processes and industry best practices as well as cloud-based application development and hosting to build a modeling framework accessible through web-based, mobile or 'stand-alone' windows user interfaces.  Web-based user interfaces can be cumbersome and ineffective for data collection across complex data domains (applications, roles, skills etc.). Data collection, data analysis, data visualization and relational evaluation is tailored to the most effective approach for the data domain being analyzed.

                            <h4>Scored Assessment Models</h4>
                            <p>Comparing an organization's processes and controls to both regulatory requirements and best practice frameworks is a key component of developing a transformation or optimization strategy. The ability to assess the maturity of an organization from a process and control perspective is essential to developing that strategy.</p>

                            <h4>Portfolio Analysis Models</h4>
                            <p>The assessment and analysis of transformation or optimization alternatives must include domains 'portfolios' or collections of assets that are not commonly included in the analysis process. Asset types or categories included in a 'portfolio' are sometimes referred to as 'resource units' in strategic sourcing strategy development. Portfolios can include applications, physical or logical servers, network nodes, storage etc. In order to comprehensively assess transformation or optimization alternatives for any organization, varying levels of 'portfolio' analysis must be completed.</p>

                            <h4>Role Analysis Models</h4>
                            <p>Roles define an associated set of tasks or activities. Roles may be performed by many people; and one person can perform many roles. For example, an organization may have several resources that perform the role of Database Administrator, although traditionally each application group or business process team only has one Database Administrator at any one time; and a person who is able to perform the role of Database Administrator may also be able to perform the role of Database Architect or Database Designer.</p>

                            <h4>Responsibility Assignment Models</h4>
                            <p>An industry best practice for defining the level of responsibility assigned to a specific 'role' is the RACI matrix which is an abbreviation for Responsible Accountable, Consulted and Informed. Also referred to as Responsibility Assignment Model (RAM), this approach maps activities and deliverables to roles for a business process.</p>
