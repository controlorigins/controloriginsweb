                <p>The Control Origins approach to transformation and optimization is based on best practices for implementing change in an organization. There have been many methods, processes, standards and practices that have been published over the past few decades which have been used to guide the development of our approach. The following list is representative but not all inclusive:</p>

                <p>The Control Origins approach is first and foremost the major phases and steps of the strategic transformation and/or optimization methodology. However, the importance of a well defined approach is also core to the structure for our 'practices taxonomy', a very key component of the Control Origins modeling framework. The practices taxonomy is used to classify all components of the framework including documents, tools, templates, digital assets and other information relevant to the strategic transformation process.</p>
