## OPPORTUNITY SECTION

### Section Title: "The Opportunity Is Clear"

### Solution Focus Areas

1. **Regulatory and Internal Control Compliance**
2. **Technical and Business Architecture Compliance**
3. **IT Strategy for Applications, Operations and Governance**
4. **Data Privacy and Information Security**

### Solution Model

"Our solution model is driven by an analytical approach that is delivered through a multi-tenant, cloud hosted solution leveraging Microsoft technology (Azure, ASP.Net, SQL Server)."

### Four Key Components

#### 1. Unified Repository

"Control Origins was founded on a unique approach to building a logical relationship between an organization's policies, procedures, standards, roles and skills to industry best practices (COSO, Cobit, ISO and ITIL) as well as regulatory requirements (SOX, HIPAA, Basel II, SSAE 16, PCI, CISP etc.). Additionally, industry specific regulations can be significant."

#### 2. Best Practices

"Whether you are charting the strategic direction of a business unit, ensuring regulatory compliance, transforming operations or optimizing sourcing models, there are a wealth of best practices that can be leveraged to assess the current state, structure transformation efforts and implement a continuous improvement lifecycle."

#### 3. Unified Analytics

"Rapidly cross-referencing and analyzing an organization's processes against both regulatory requirements and best practice frameworks is a critical component of any transformation assessment. Mapping those varied elements to an organization's roles, skills and responsibilities can only be efficiently accomplished with a robust data and analytics model."

#### 4. Unified Modeling

"There is a wide variety of best practices, regulatory requirements and business requirements that must be addressed in any transformation strategy. The 'origin' and approach of each of these components is highly varied demanding a unified modeling framework that will provide many benefits including:"

---

## APPROACH SECTION

### Methodology Foundation

"The Control Origins approach to transformation and optimization is based on best practices for implementing change in an organization. There have been many methods, processes, standards and practices that have been published over the past few decades which have been used to guide the development of our approach."

### Five Foundational Models

#### 1. PDCA Model

"Plan, Do, Check, Act model or 'Shewhart Cycle' published by W. Edwards Deming"

#### 2. DMAIC Model

"Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control model which is a data-driven improvement cycle adopted by Motorola's Six Sigma methodology"

#### 3. OODA Model

"Observe, Orient, Decide and Act model published by military strategist and USAF Colonel John Boyd"

#### 4. PO/AI/DS/ME Model

"Plan and Organize, Acquire and Implement, Deliver and Support and Monitor and Evaluate model published in ISACA's COBIT framework"

#### 5. SS/SD/ST/SO Model

"Service Strategy, Service Design, Service transition and Service Operation published in ITIL"

### Practices Taxonomy

"The Control Origins approach is first and foremost the major phases and steps of the strategic transformation and/or optimization methodology. However, the importance of a well defined approach is also core to the structure for our 'practices taxonomy', a very key component of the Control Origins modeling framework. The practices taxonomy is used to classify all components of the framework including documents, tools, templates, digital assets and other information relevant to the strategic transformation process."

### Six-Phase Methodology

#### 1. Discover Phase

"The Discover phase of the Control Origins methodology is targeted at developing a detailed understanding of the organization's business goals and objectives as well the alignment of the organization being analyzed to those business goals and objectives."

#### 2. Assess Phase

"This phase of the Control Origins approach is targeted at developing a detailed understanding of the organizations service delivery quality, process maturity and cost effectiveness."

#### 3. Define Phase

"The Define phase of the Control Origins methodology is targeted at the detailed definition of all components of the transformation or optimization alternatives that have been prioritized for implementation."

#### 4. Design Phase

"The Design phase of the Control Origins methodology is targeted at developing the detailed specifications for building the components of transformation or optimization from the Define process."

#### 5. Implement Phase

"The Implement phase of the Control Origins methodology is targeted at constructing or building the transformation and/or optimization components that were specified in Design."

#### 6. Optimize Phase

"The Optimize phase of the Control Origins methodology is targeted at continuous improvement of the transformation and/or optimization components that were delivered in Implement"

## DATA & ANALYTICAL MODELS SECTION

### Section Overview

"Rapidly cross-referencing and analyzing an organization's processes against regulatory requirements and best practice frameworks is a critical component of any transformation assessment. Mapping those varied elements to an organization's roles, skills and responsibilities can only be efficiently accomplished with a robust data and analytics model."

### Baseline Development Process

"Evaluating enterprise IT processes should begin with creation of a clear 'baseline' of the current process and control environment. To establish the baseline, the relationship between procedures, standards, roles, skills, best practices, regulatory requirements must be explicitly defined. Once defined, the baseline is used to complete a 'gap analysis' of an organization's process and control hierarchy through a capability maturity assessment process."

### Technical Implementation

"The Control Origins team leveraged deep experience in processes and industry best practices as well as cloud-based application development and hosting to build a modeling framework accessible through web-based, mobile or 'stand-alone' windows user interfaces. Web-based user interfaces can be cumbersome and ineffective for data collection across complex data domains (applications, roles, skills etc.). Data collection, data analysis, data visualization and relational evaluation is tailored to the most effective approach for the data domain being analyzed."

### Four Model Types

#### 1. Scored Assessment Models

"Comparing an organization's processes and controls to both regulatory requirements and best practice frameworks is a key component of developing a transformation or optimization strategy. The ability to assess the maturity of an organization from a process and control perspective is essential to developing that strategy."

#### 2. Portfolio Analysis Models

"The assessment and analysis of transformation or optimization alternatives must include domains 'portfolios' or collections of assets that are not commonly included in the analysis process. Asset types or categories included in a 'portfolio' are sometimes referred to as 'resource units' in strategic sourcing strategy development. Portfolios can include applications, physical or logical servers, network nodes, storage etc. In order to comprehensively assess transformation or optimization alternatives for any organization, varying levels of 'portfolio' analysis must be completed."

#### 3. Role Analysis Models

"Roles define an associated set of tasks or activities. Roles may be performed by many people; and one person can perform many roles. For example, an organization may have several resources that perform the role of Database Administrator, although traditionally each application group or business process team only has one Database Administrator at any one time; and a person who is able to perform the role of Database Administrator may also be able to perform the role of Database Architect or Database Designer."

#### 4. Responsibility Assignment Models

"An industry best practice for defining the level of responsibility assigned to a specific 'role' is the RACI matrix which is an abbreviation for Responsible Accountable, Consulted and Informed. Also referred to as Responsibility Assignment Model (RAM), this approach maps activities and deliverables to roles for a business process."

### Published Articles and Content

#### 1. Lifelong Learning (May 22, 2022)

"As a lifelong learner, I have had to adapt how I acquire and strengthen my skills. Over my time in the technology industry, we have moved from in-person classrooms and running to the bookstore when assigned a new project to virtually unlimited options, most online and for relatively little or no cost."

#### 2. Project Conflict Management (April 27, 2022)

"Conflict is inevitable in a team environment. Project teams bring together a variety of personalities and skills, each perceiving tasks and actions in different ways. This diversity is what gives the team depth and a broad range of skills required to successfully achieve the project objectives. Yet, this diversity will inevitably bring conflicts ranging from simple disagreements on task details to fundamental personality clashes."

#### 3. How to Automate Your Deployments with Azure DevOps (April 23, 2020)

"In software application lifecycle management (ALM), the deployment of new code to production can be a risky proposition. During a production deployment, the tightly controlled production environment are opened up and new code replaces the old code. Improper deployment of code can cause excessive downtime and loss of business. Many times, the production deployment is performed by a few trusted administers with limited knowledge of the development process. Instead, a system admin doing a copy-paste of files at three in the morning, what if you had a consistent, measurable, auditable, and repeatable way of deploying code consistently. This is where Azure DevOps release pipelines can replace manual repetitive process."
